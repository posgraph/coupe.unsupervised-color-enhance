# Unsupervised Color Enhancement

Tensorflow implementation for learning an image-to-image color enhancement using CycleGAN structure (unsupervised).

For image example:
![color_enhance](/assets/color_enhance.png)

It learns color affine transform function for each pixel in CIE L\*a\*b\*.
Network structure for transformation network looks:
![affine_structure](/assets/affine_structure.png)

This implementation is based on CycleGAN-tensorflow of xhujoy (https://github.com/xhujoy).
This repository contains train and test codes for reproduce.
Pretrained network model and dataset will be distributed soon.

--------------------------

## Prerequisites
- tensorflow r1.0 or higher version
- numpy 1.11.0
- scipy 0.17.0
- pillow 3.3.0

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Install tensorflow from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JunhoJeon/unsupervised-color-enhance
cd CycleGAN-tensorflow
```

## Training and Test Details
To train a model,  
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=/path/to/data/
```
Models are saved to `./checkpoints/` (can be changed by passing `--checkpoint_dir=your_dir`).  

To test the model,
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=/path/to/data/ --phase=test --which_direction=AtoB/BtoA
```

## About Coupe Project ##
Project ‘COUPE’ aims to develop software that evaluates and improves the quality of images and videos based on big visual data. To achieve the goal, we extract sharpness, color, composition features from images and develop technologies for restoring and improving by using it. In addition, personalization technology through user preference analysis is under study.
